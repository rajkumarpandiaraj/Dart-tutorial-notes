                            4.Data Types and Variables

Built-in Data Types :
    Dart has special support for these data types :
        1.Numbers
            --> int 
            --> double
        2.Strings
        3.Booleans
        4.Lists(also known as Arrays)
        5.Maps
        6.Runs (for expressing unicode in a String)
        7.symbols

    Now we are going to see about number,string and Booleans

variable declaration

    DataType<space>VariableName = value

Example 
    int age = 10
    double weight = 1.2
    string name = 'Rk'
    bool isAlive = false

we can use var keyword as dataType, it refers the dataType based on the value

Example
    var age = 10
    var weight = 1.2
    var name = 'RK'
    var isAlive = false
