                            24.Inheritance in Dart

Inheritance :
    inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires properties of its parent class Object.


Types of inheritance

Single inhertiance :
             OBJECT
                |
                |
            class  A 
                |
                |
                |
            class B
    
Class b Inherits the property from the class A, 
Here class A is a parent class or Base class or super Class
Class B is the child class or Sub Class of class A

Multi Level Inheritance :
              OBJECT
                |
                |
            class  A 
                |
                |
                |
            class B
                |
                |
                |
            Class C 
        
Here Class C inherts from class B and Class B inherits from class A 
Class C is the child class for both class A and Class B  
Class B is the parent class for class C and chid class for class A 
Class A is The Parent Class for bith class B and C 


Hierarchial Inheritance :
             OBJECT
                |
                |
            class  A  ---------> Class C
                |
                |
                |
            class B

Here class B and C inherits from the class A 
Class A is the parent class for both  B and C  



By Default every class is extended from the object, that provides some property and methods
--> super class of any class is Object:
    -> Provides default implementation of :
        -> toString(), return the string respresentation of the object
        -> hashCode Getter, returns the Hash Code of an Object
        -> Operator ==, to compare two Objects

syntax:
class <child_className> extends <parent_className>{

}

Use "extends" keyword to inherit the property from the base class

Example :
    void main() {

	var dog = Dog();
	dog.breed = "Labrador";
	dog.color = "Black";
	dog.bark();
	dog.eat();

	var cat = Cat();
	cat.color = "White";
	cat.age = 6;
	cat.eat();
	cat.meow();

	var animal = Animal();
	animal.color = "brown";
	animal.eat();
}

class Animal {

	String color;

	void eat() {
		print("Eat !");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {      // Dog is Child class or sub class, Animal is super or parent class

	String breed;

	void bark() {
		print("Bark !");
	}
}

class Cat extends Animal {      // Cat is Child class or sub class, Animal is super or parent class

	int age;

	void meow() {
		print("Meow !");
	}
}
