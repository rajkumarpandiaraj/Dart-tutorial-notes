    int age = 10;
    double weight = 12.5;


    Strings
        string name = 'Rk';
        string name1 = "Rk" //we can use double quotes too
        // string message = 'Hi this is Rk' + 
                            'How are you?' //In we don't want to use '+';
        string message = 'Hi this is Rk'
                            'How are you?';

    string Interpolation [$ or ${}]
    string name = "Rk";
    print("my Name is $name ") //my Name is Rk
    print("my name is ${name.length}") // my name is 2
