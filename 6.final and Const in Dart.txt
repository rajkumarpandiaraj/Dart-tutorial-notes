                                6.final and const 

why we need final and Const?
    --> If you never want to change a value then use final and const keywords
    final name = "Rk";
    const Pi = 3.14;

Difference between final and const
    final variable get initializs in memory, if you are using it, if not, it didn't get intialized in memory.
    const variable is implicitly final but it a compile-time constant
        --> const gets intialized in memory on compile time and converted to final

    const keyword cannot be used inside the class, to use const inside the class,
        use static const
    we can use final inside the class

    class city{
        final cityName = 'Chennai'
        static const cityName1 = 'CBE'
    }
