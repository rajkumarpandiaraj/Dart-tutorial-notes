                25.Method Overriding and Property Overriding


void main() {

	var dog = Dog();
	dog.breed = "Labrador";
	dog.color = "Black";
	dog.eat();
}

class Animal {

	String color;

	void eat() {
		print("Animal is Eating");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {      // Dog is Child class or sub class, Animal is super or parent class

	String breed;

	void bark() {
		print("Bark !");
	}
}

O/P :
    Animal is Eating

Instead of animal is Eating, if you want to print Dog is Eating.
use method Overriding

use the same class name and return type defined in the parent class in child class

void main() {

	var dog = Dog();
	dog.breed = "Labrador";
	dog.color = "Black";
	dog.eat();
}

class Animal {

	String color;

	void eat() {
		print("Animal is Eating");
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {      // Dog is Child class or sub class, Animal is super or parent class

	String breed;

	void bark() {
		print("Bark !");
	}

    void eat() {
		print("Dog is Eating");
	}
}

O/P :
    Dog is Eating



use super keyword to print both the methods

void main() {

	var dog = Dog();
	dog.breed = "Labrador";
	dog.color = "Black";
	dog.eat();
}

class Animal {

	String color;

	void eat() {
		print("Animal is Eating");
	}1
}

class Dog extends Animal {      // Dog is Child class or sub class, Animal is super or parent class

	String breed;

	void bark() {
		print("Bark !");
	}

    void eat() {
        super.eat()
		print("Dog is Eating");
	}
}

O/P :
    Animal is Eating
    Dog is Eating




we can also define th properties in the child class to override the properties
